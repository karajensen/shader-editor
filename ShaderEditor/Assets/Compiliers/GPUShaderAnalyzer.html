<p><a name="Overview"><h3>Overview</h3></p>
<p>GPU ShaderAnalyzer is a tool for analyzing the performance of pixel, vertex, geometry, hull, domain and compute shaders for ATI Radeon&trade; graphics cards. It gives you accurate performance estimates for your shaders and even allows you to view disassembly of the generated hardware shader, all without having to run the application on actual hardware. GPU ShaderAnalyzer can be used as a GUI tool for interactive tuning of your shaders or in command line mode to generate detailed reports. It supports Direct3D (D3D9.0 - D3D11) and OpenGL (GLSL 1.50, arb_fp and arb_vp) shaders.</p>

        <dt><b>GLSL unsized arrays are not supported</b></dt>
        <dd>GLSL geometry shaders which declare input/output variables as unsized arrays are not supported. Please explicitly declare the size of the array to match the number of primitive vertices.</dd>
        <dt><b>Incomplete handling of R6xx HW Break & Continue instructions</b></dt>
        <dd>The current implementation takes some account of break & continue instructions but research is ongoing on understanding the full performance implications of these instructions. If your shader makes usage of the break instruction you can still consider the reported performance estimates as good but if for instance you know that the break will likely be triggered after only a few iterations of a loop then you should factor this into your analysis.</dd>
        <dt><b>OpenGL vertex shaders not supported on R3xx-R5xx GPUs</b></dt>
        <dt><b>General Purpose Register usage is not currently considered</b></dt>
        <dd>In circumstances where a shader has a high latency (generally when there is a high texture dependency level) and high GPR usage the GPU can run out of the GPRs that is uses to hide latency. In these circumstances lowering the number of GPRs can improve shader performance.
        This is not currently factored into GSAs analysis but it is something we are actively researching.</dd>
        <dt><b>Unmatched <tt>#ifdef</tt> with <tt>#endif</tt> usage can cause crashes</b></dt>
        <dd>If you suffer crashes when editing shaders which use preprocessor commands (<tt>#ifdef</tt>, <tt>#endif</tt>, etc.) it is recommended that you disable <b>Auto Compile</b> in the Options dialog and instead click the "Compile" button when you have completed editting your shader.</dd>

<p><a name="Getting Started"><h3>Getting Started</h3></p>
<ul>
        <li>Enter your shader into the <b>Source Code</b> window. You can load it via the File menu, drag and drop it onto the window or type it in from scratch if you prefer.
        <li>If you load your shader via the File menu or drag and drop, GPU ShaderAnalyzer will attempt to automatically detect the shader type.<i>This functionality can be changed in the <b>Options</b></i>.
        <li>Ensure the <b>Source type</b> is set correctly and, if required, the HLSL or GLSL <b>Target</b> is also set correctly for your shader.
        <li>If your shader is HLSL then you may need to set the <b>Function</b> correctly for your shader.
        <li>Click the <b>Compile</b> button. <i>Auto compile can be enabled in the <b>Options</b></i>
        <li>If your shader is compiled successfully you should see the disassembly of it in the <b>Object Code</b> window.
</ul>
The <b>Compiler Statistics</b> window and <b>D3D Assembly Statistics window</b> will list statistics about your program. If you wish to see disassembly of the hardware shader as generated by ATI’s Shader Compiler, you may select the ATI Radeon&trade; graphics card you are interested in from the <b>Format</b> list above the <b>Object Code</b>.

<p><a name="Compiler Statistics"><h3>About the Compiler Statistics</h3></p>
<p>GPU ShaderAnalyzer (GSA) analyzes the hardware shader generated by ATI’s Shader Compiler and estimates the number of cycles it will take to process each pixel, vertex or primitive. For shaders that contain flow control instructions, the quoted figures are the estimated average performance results. If your shader always executes the maximum number of loops or always takes the slowest execution path then your runtime results will differ.</p>
<p>The cost of texture instructions varies with the type of filtering being used so GSA quotes figures for bilinear, trilinear and anisotropic filtering. These figures are based on the estimated cost of filtering once texture caching has been taken into account. If your shader is ALU bound rather than texture bound then increasing the texture filtering level may have no effect on performance. Estimates are based upon 32bpp textures, wider format textures will have a greater performance cost. If your texture usage shows bad cache coherence then the cost of texture instructions can be much higher. This is not factored into GSA's calculations as in this case performance is considered to be texture bound rather than shader bound.</p>
<p>The ALU:Tex ratio statistics estimate how close you are to the sweet spot of balancing the ALU and Texture cost of your shader. This information can guide you as to where you have extra ALU compute available to spare. ALU:Tex ratios of 1.2 or greater are highlighted in green and those of 0.9 or less are highlighted in red. When a particular GPU has the capability to execute multiple ALU instructions on each pixel this is factored into GSA's analysis.</p>
